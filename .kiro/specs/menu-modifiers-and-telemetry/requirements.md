# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Menu Modifiers and Telemetry Enhancement adds two key capabilities to the existing Subway Enterprise system: a comprehensive modifier system for menu items (allowing items to have customizable options like bread types and extras) and a telemetry infrastructure for future AI-driven features. This builds upon the existing menu management, store filtering, and analytics capabilities without duplicating functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Menu Item Modifier System

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to manage modifier groups and attach them to menu items, so that customers can customize their orders with options like bread types and extras.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing modifier groups THEN the system SHALL display all available modifier groups with their descriptions
2. WHEN managing a menu item THEN the system SHALL show available and currently attached modifier groups
3. WHEN attaching a modifier group to an item THEN the system SHALL create the relationship and update the UI optimistically
4. WHEN detaching a modifier group THEN the system SHALL remove the relationship and provide visual feedback
5. IF modifier operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback optimistic updates and show error messages
6. WHEN modifier data loads THEN the system SHALL handle loading states gracefully

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Menu Item Creation

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want improved menu item creation with better validation and user experience, so that I can efficiently add items with proper data validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening the item creation form THEN the name field SHALL be auto-focused
2. WHEN entering price data THEN the system SHALL validate decimal format and show inline errors
3. WHEN successfully creating an item THEN the system SHALL show a success toast notification
4. WHEN choosing "Create & add another" THEN the form SHALL reset but keep the drawer open
5. IF creation fails THEN the system SHALL show specific error messages and maintain form state

### Requirement 3: Telemetry and Feature Flag Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a development team, I want telemetry collection and feature flag capabilities, so that we can prepare for AI-driven features and A/B testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN telemetry events are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate event structure and store in database
2. WHEN feature flags are configured THEN they SHALL be stored with proper versioning and status tracking
3. WHEN experiments are created THEN they SHALL track status, dates, and associated feature flags
4. IF telemetry submission fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting user experience
5. WHEN in development mode THEN admin users SHALL have access to telemetry debug tools

### Requirement 4: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a development team, I want proper seed data and testing infrastructure, so that we can ensure system reliability and have consistent development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running seed scripts THEN the system SHALL create realistic modifier groups and sample relationships
2. WHEN BFF routes are called THEN they SHALL return consistent data shapes matching API contracts
3. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL cover critical user journeys for modifier management
4. WHEN database migrations run THEN they SHALL properly create all required tables and relationships

### Requirement 5: System Integration and Quality

**User Story:** As a development team, I want all new features to integrate seamlessly with existing functionality, so that the system remains stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new features are added THEN they SHALL follow existing architectural patterns and styling
2. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL use consistent error handling and response formats
3. WHEN UI components are built THEN they SHALL match existing design system and accessibility standards
4. WHEN database changes are made THEN they SHALL include proper migrations and maintain data integrity
5. IF any integration issues occur THEN they SHALL be resolved without breaking existing functionality
