# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Subway Enterprise Multi-Phase Delivery System is a comprehensive enhancement plan that systematically improves the existing restaurant management system through 6 distinct phases. The system will enhance CI/CD processes, polish menu management UX, improve stores and analytics functionality, add data ergonomics, implement testing infrastructure, and establish AI foundations. Each phase builds upon the previous one while maintaining system stability and following established architectural patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CI/CD Infrastructure Setup

**User Story:** As a development team, I want automated CI/CD checks to ensure code quality and prevent regressions, so that we can maintain system reliability across all pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is created THEN the system SHALL automatically run typecheck, lint, and build processes
2. WHEN CI checks fail THEN the system SHALL prevent merge until issues are resolved
3. WHEN CI setup is complete THEN the README SHALL display status badges indicating build health
4. IF any CI check fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and remediation guidance

### Requirement 2: Menu Management UX Polish

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want a polished menu management interface with proper table alignment and compact controls, so that I can efficiently manage menu items and their modifiers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the menu table THEN all columns SHALL be center-aligned except the first column which SHALL be left-aligned
2. WHEN using header controls THEN category select, search input, and "Create Item" button SHALL be inline with 12-16px spacing
3. WHEN opening the Create Item drawer THEN it SHALL slide from the right without pushing content down
4. WHEN pressing ESC key THEN any open drawer SHALL close immediately
5. WHEN managing item modifiers THEN the system SHALL display available and attached modifier groups with attach/detach functionality
6. WHEN attaching/detaching modifiers THEN the UI SHALL update optimistically with fallback refresh on errors

### Requirement 3: Stores and Analytics Enhancement

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want cascading filters for stores and live-updating analytics, so that I can efficiently browse regional data and monitor KPIs in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN filtering stores THEN region/country/city filters SHALL cascade and reflect in query string
2. WHEN page refreshes THEN filter selections SHALL be retained from query string
3. WHEN changing analytics filters THEN KPI cards SHALL update live without requiring an Apply button
4. WHEN viewing analytics THEN filter controls SHALL match global styling (.s-input/.s-select/.s-btn)
5. WHEN analytics load THEN Orders/Revenue/Menu Items/Pending cards SHALL read from /kpis and /kpis/daily endpoints with proper scope parameters

### Requirement 4: Menu Data Ergonomics

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want streamlined menu item creation with smart defaults and validation, so that I can quickly add multiple items without repetitive data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a menu item THEN the category SHALL default to the currently selected filter
2. WHEN the item creation form opens THEN the Name field SHALL be auto-focused
3. WHEN entering price data THEN the system SHALL validate decimal format and prevent invalid entries
4. WHEN successfully creating an item THEN the system SHALL show a success toast notification
5. WHEN choosing "Create & add another" THEN the drawer SHALL remain open with form reset for rapid entry

### Requirement 5: Testing and Seed Data Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive test coverage and realistic seed data, so that we can ensure system reliability and have consistent development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running seed scripts THEN the system SHALL create 2 modifier groups (Bread, Extras) with 1 attached item
2. WHEN BFF routes are called THEN they SHALL return expected data shapes matching API contracts
3. WHEN running e2e tests THEN the system SHALL verify menu modifier attach/detach flow from UI to database
4. WHEN tests execute THEN they SHALL cover happy-path scenarios for critical user journeys

### Requirement 6: AI Foundations Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a development team, I want telemetry and feature flag infrastructure in place, so that we can prepare for future AI-driven features and A/B testing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN telemetry events are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate and store them in the database
2. WHEN feature flags are configured THEN they SHALL be stored in a dedicated table with proper schema
3. WHEN in development mode THEN admin users SHALL have access to debug toggles for testing telemetry
4. WHEN experiments are created THEN they SHALL be tracked in a dedicated experiments table
5. IF telemetry submission fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without affecting user experience

### Requirement 7: System Integrity and Quality Standards

**User Story:** As a development team, I want all changes to maintain system integrity and follow established patterns, so that the codebase remains maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making any changes THEN the system SHALL pass typecheck, lint, and build processes
2. WHEN UI changes are made THEN they SHALL not produce console errors in the admin interface
3. WHEN pull requests are created THEN they SHALL include summary, screenshots for UI changes, and manual test notes
4. WHEN possible THEN pull request diffs SHALL be â‰¤150 lines of code with larger work split into stacked PRs
5. WHEN database changes are needed THEN proper Prisma migrations SHALL be created and documented
6. WHEN new environment variables are added THEN they SHALL be documented in the PR and follow existing naming conventions
