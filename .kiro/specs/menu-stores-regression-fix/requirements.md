# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Menu Management and Store Management pages have regressed after running a Code Quality Analyzer. The pages were previously working well but now have styling inconsistencies, broken layouts, and mixed CSS approaches that need to be resolved to restore functionality and maintain a consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to the Menu Management page THEN the menu items SHALL be displayed in a properly formatted table
2. WHEN I view the menu table THEN all columns SHALL be properly aligned and styled consistently
3. WHEN I hover over table rows THEN they SHALL provide visual feedback with appropriate hover states
4. WHEN I interact with action buttons THEN they SHALL be clearly visible and properly styled

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the Store Management page to display store information in a consistent layout that matches the overall design system, so that I can efficiently manage store locations.

4. WHEN I need to debug styling issues THEN the CSS SHALL be organized in logical sections with clear comments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want both pages to have consistent visual design and behavior, so that I have a cohesive experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate between Menu and Store pages THEN the header sections SHALL have consistent styling and layout
2. WHEN I use search and filter controls THEN they SHALL behave consistently across both pages
3. WHEN I interact with drawers and modals THEN they SHALL have consistent styling and animations
4. WHEN I view data tables THEN they SHALL follow the same design patterns and interaction models
