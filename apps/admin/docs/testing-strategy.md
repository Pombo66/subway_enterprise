# Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the navigation consolidation feature. The testing suite is designed to ensure all functionality works correctly across navigation, CRUD operations, and API integrations.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Tests
- **Location**: `apps/admin/app/components/__tests__/`, `apps/admin/lib/__tests__/`
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Individual components, hooks, and utility functions
- **Focus**: Component behavior, state management, form validation

### 2. Integration Tests  
- **Location**: `apps/bff/test/integration/`
- **Framework**: Jest + Supertest
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database operations, service layer
- **Focus**: Data flow, business logic, error handling

### 3. End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `apps/admin/e2e/`
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Complete user workflows, navigation flows, CRUD operations
- **Focus**: User experience, cross-browser compatibility, accessibility

## Test Categories

### Navigation Tests
- Sidebar navigation structure (6 top-level items)
- Tab navigation within sections
- URL redirects for legacy routes
- Keyboard navigation accessibility
- Mobile responsive navigation

### CRUD Workflow Tests
- Menu Items: Create, Read, Update, Delete operations
- Categories: CRUD with drag-and-drop reordering
- Modifiers: Hierarchical management and item attachment
- Pricing: Base price editing and override comparison
- Stores: Store management and pricing overrides
- Settings: Users, audit logs, and feature flags

### API Integration Tests
- Request/response validation
- Error handling and status codes
- Database transaction integrity
- Audit trail generation
- Telemetry event emission

### Design Consistency Tests
- Component styling preservation
- Design token usage
- Responsive behavior
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

## Test Data Management

### Seed Data
- Comprehensive test data in `packages/db/prisma/seed.mjs`
- Realistic data for all entities (items, categories, modifiers, stores)
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Multi-tenant data scenarios

### Test Utilities
- Page object models for E2E tests
- Component test helpers and wrappers
- API test fixtures and mocks
- Database cleanup and setup utilities

## Testing Infrastructure

### Configuration Files
- `apps/admin/jest.config.js` - Unit test configuration
- `apps/admin/playwright.config.ts` - E2E test configuration  
- `apps/bff/jest.config.js` - Backend unit tests
- `apps/bff/jest.integration.config.js` - Integration tests

### Test Commands
```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm -C apps/admin test
pnpm -C apps/bff test

# Integration tests  
pnpm -C apps/bff test:integration

# E2E tests
pnpm -C apps/admin test:e2e

# All tests
pnpm test:all
```

### Continuous Integration
- Pre-commit hooks for test execution
- CI pipeline integration with test reporting
- Coverage thresholds and quality gates
- Cross-browser testing matrix

## Quality Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- Unit tests: 80% line coverage minimum
- Integration tests: 90% API endpoint coverage
- E2E tests: 100% critical user journey coverage

### Performance Benchmarks
- Page load times under 2 seconds
- API response times under 500ms
- Database query optimization
- Bundle size monitoring

### Accessibility Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast validation

## Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Test data refresh with production-like scenarios
- Browser compatibility matrix updates
- Performance baseline adjustments
- Security vulnerability scanning

### Documentation
- Test case documentation and rationale
- Known issues and workarounds
- Testing best practices and guidelines
- Troubleshooting common test failures

## Implementation Status

The testing infrastructure is fully configured and ready for implementation. All test frameworks are properly set up with appropriate configurations, utilities, and documentation.

**Note**: The specific test implementations (16.1, 16.2, 16.3) are marked as optional in the task list and can be implemented as needed based on project requirements and priorities.
