## Test Commands

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test:all

# Run specific test types
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:lint
pnpm test:typecheck

# Validate test setup
node scripts/validate-test-setup.mjs
```

### Test Results

Current test execution shows:
- **Infrastructure**: âœ… Fully configured and operational

   - Update browser compatibility matrix
   - Maintain CI/CD pipeline integration

3. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - Update test documentation
   - Maintain troubleshooting guides
   - Document new testing patterns

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
1. **Test Failures**: Check API response format changes
2. **Setup Issues**: Run validation script for diagnosis
3. **Performance**: Monitor test execution times
4. **Dependencies**: Keep testing libraries updated

## Conclusion

The comprehensive testing suite infrastructure is fully implemented and operational. The system provides a solid foundation for maintaining code quality and ensuring reliable functionality across the navigation consolidation feature.

The optional test implementations (16.1, 16.2, 16.3) can be added incrementally based on project needs and priorities. The infrastructure is designed to support these additions seamlessly when required.

**Status**: âœ… Complete - Testing infrastructure ready for production use
