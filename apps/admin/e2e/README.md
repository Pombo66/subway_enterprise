## Test Execution

### Running All Tests
```bash
cd apps/admin
npx playwright test
```

### Running Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Navigation tests only
npx playwright test navigation-consolidation.e2e.spec.ts

# Redirect tests only
npx playwright test legacy-redirects.e2e.spec.ts

# Menu CRUD tests
npx playwright test menu-items-crud.e2e.spec.ts

### Running Tests in Headed Mode (for debugging)
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Generating Test Report
```bash
npx playwright test --reporter=html
```

## Test Data Requirements

The tests assume the following seed data exists:
- At least 3 menu items with various categories and modifiers
- At least 3 categories with different item counts
- At least 3 modifier groups with individual modifiers
- At least 3 stores with some pricing overrides
- Users with different roles for settings tests

## Test Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Page Object Pattern
Tests use locators and expect statements that follow Playwright best practices:
- Use `data-testid` attributes for reliable element selection
- Use role-based selectors when appropriate
- Avoid brittle CSS selectors

### 2. Error Handling
All tests include error scenarios:
- API error mocking and validation
- Form validation testing
- Network failure simulation
- User feedback verification

### 3. Accessibility Testing
Tests include keyboard navigation and accessibility checks:
- Tab navigation through forms
- ESC key handling for modals
- ARIA attributes validation
- Screen reader compatibility

### 4. Data Integrity
Tests verify data consistency:
- Form pre-population accuracy
- Cancel operations don't modify data
- Bulk operations affect correct items
- Relationship integrity maintenance
